If you are working outside the UCL network you will need to connect through our Gateway machine 
before accessing Myriad or other local clusters, so you will need to copy your public key to the 
Gateway machine too:

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub {{ site.remote.user }}@ssh-gateway.ucl.ac.uk:~/
```
{: .language-bash}
